SUMMARY

This test driver builds a sparse matrix with 25 non-zeros per row (on average) with the specified local grid dimensions.
It then tests the performance of:
- sparse matrix-vector multiplication, 
- sparse matrix-multivector multiplication for 2, 4, 8 RHS,
- vector 2-norm (for a vector of the same global dimension as the sparse matrix)
- vector dot product
- vector axpy (y = alpha*x + y)

Run the command without any arguments to see the usage of the executable.

HOW TO BUILD

1) Download Trilinos from http://trilinos.sandia.gov

2) Install Trilinos as follows:

- Untar the Trilinos source code.  Put it within the EpetraBenchmarkTest directory, or put it somewhere 
  more central if you are going to use Trilinos for other purposes.
- The EpetraBenchmarkTest mini-driver can build with one of three instance of Trilinos: Serial, OpenMP and MPI.
- These instructions are for the MPI build.  The OpenMP and Serial builds are nearly identical.
- "cd" to the directory EPETRA_MPI_BUILD within the EpetraBenchmarkTest directory.
- Edit the do-configure file in this directory and define TRILINOS_PATH to point to your copy of Trilinos.
- You will also need to redefine the paths for the MPI compilers, and perhaps make other modification.
  The Trilinos website has extensive help for getting Trilinos built.  The trilinos-users@software.sandia.gov
  mail list is also very helpful.
- Once your do-configure script is sane, you can execute it by typing "source do-configure", which will build
  the Epetra package needed for this mini-driver.
  NOTE:  You will need a valid installation of BLAS and LAPACK.  See the Trilinos installation guide for details
         (at the Trilinos website).
- Once you successfully configure Trilinos, type "make; make install"


3) Once Trilinos is built, "cd" to the directory BENCHMARK_MPI_BUILD within the EpetraBenchmarkTest directory.

4) Type "make" in this directory.  This should build an executable called EpetraBenchmarkTest.exe.

5) Run the executable.  The file "go" in this directory gives an example of how to run the executable
   to get timing information.
